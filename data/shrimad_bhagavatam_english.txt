I was born in the darkest ignorance, and my spiritual master opened my eyes with the torch of
knowledge. I offer my respectful obeisances unto him.

When will Srila Rupa Goswami Prabhupada, who has established within this material world the
mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Chaitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?


I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master and unto the feet of
all vaiñëavas, I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Srila Rupa Goswami along
with his elder brother Sanatan Goswami, as well as Raghunath Das and Raghunath Bhatta,
Gopal Bhatta, and Srila Jiva Goswami. I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Krishna
Chaitanya and Lord Nityananda along with Adwaita Acharya, Gadadhar, Srivas, and other
associates. I offer my respectful obeisances to Srimati Radharani and Sri Krishna along with
Their associates Sri Lalita and Visakha


O my dear Krishna, O ocean of mercy, You are the friend of the distressed and the source of
creation. You are the master of the gopés and the lover of Radharani. I offer my respectful
obeisances unto you

Ioffer my respects to Radharani, whose bodily complexion is like molten gold and who is the
Queen of Vrindavan. You are the daughter of King Vrishabhanu, and you are very dear to Lord
Krishna.


I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the vaiñëava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the
desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls
